	+ Requests for code help should be accompanied by code snippets for already been tried, along with a description of ultimate objective.

	+ This is a forum, and you are posting because you are expecting replies. So questions like "Can someone help?" are superfluous.

## Responding to questions

	+ This is not a platform for name calling, people come to the forum to learn and will make mistakes, so please provide help 
2. [Reply to first offender offline](#givethemachance)
	+ There will be newbies and folks who want to stay newbies. Differentiate between them and help out the real newbies when they first join the forum. This is how the community will grow
3. [If you don't know for sure, say so](#behonest)
	+ Even if you're not completely sure of your answer, it is encouraged to share your thoughts on the forum. However if you are not sure of your response make sure you say so.
4. [Ask probing questions to elicit more details](#improvethequestion)
	+ If you don't understand the question, make sure to ask questions back to the OP such that they can provide more details rather than showing them down
5. [Reframe the question](#reframe)
	+ If you think you understand the question well, but it is not in general clear for the audience, feel free to reframe the question
6. [Take useful derived questions to community thinkers](#startdiscussion)
	+ There will always be side effects from either the nature or content of the discussion that may need a higher level discussion. If this is the case, as a high level moderator take it to the next level for a discussion between the moderators. 
7. [Declare conflicts of interests / disclaimers](#disclaimer)
	+ It is perfectly fine to mention a specific software or library that you (co-)developed as solution to the respective problem, but please add a disclaimer.

## What if you don't get a response?

1. [Be patient](#patience)
	+ Sometimes community members and moderators are on travel or the question need an important amount of investigation 
2. [Be proactive](#proactive)
	+ Show the community your diligence by posting any progress you have made so far on the same issue while waiting for answers
