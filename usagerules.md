	+ Don't give precise but biased answers. If you are not sure of your response make sure you convey that message
4. [Ask probing questions to elicit more details](#improvethequestion)
	+ If you don't understand the question, make sure to ask questions back to the OP such that they can provide more details rather than showing them down
5. [Reframe the question](#reframe)
	+ If you think (as a moderator) you understand the question well, but it is not in general clear for the audience, feel free to reframe the question
6. [Take useful derived questions to community thinkers](#startdiscussion)
	+ There will always be side effects from either the nature or content of the discussion that may need a higher level discussion. If this is the case, as a high level moderator take it to the next level for a discussion between the moderators.
